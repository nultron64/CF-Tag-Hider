Web extension for Code Forces: Injects a button at the head of "Problem Tags" block to hide/unhide the problem tags. It hides the problem tags by default, click the `show` button to see the problem tags.

This works for URLs in the format `https://codeforces.com/*/problem/*`.

Note:
- It considers the first div of the class "roundbox sidebox borderTopRound" that contains the text "â†’ Problem tags" in it's innerText.
- It changes the `position` of that div to `relative` and inserts a new button.
